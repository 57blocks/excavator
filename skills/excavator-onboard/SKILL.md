# /excavator-onboard

Generate a comprehensive onboarding guide from the project's knowledge graph.

## Graph Structure Reference

The knowledge graph JSON has this structure:
- `project` — {name, description, languages, frameworks, analyzedAt, gitCommitHash}
- `nodes[]` — each has {id, type, name, filePath?, summary, tags[], complexity, languageNotes?}
  - Code node types: file, function, class, module, concept
  - Non-code node types: config, document, service, table, endpoint, pipeline, schema, resource
  - Domain/knowledge node types: domain, flow, step, article, entity, topic, claim, source
  - IDs use the node type as prefix, e.g. `file:path`, `function:path:name`, `config:path`, `article:path`
- `edges[]` — each has {source, target, type, direction, weight}
  - Key types: imports, contains, calls, depends_on, configures, documents, deploys, triggers, contains_flow, flow_step, related, cites
- `layers[]` — each has {id, name, description, nodeIds[]}
- `tour[]` — compatibility field; new service graphs store an empty array

## How to Read Efficiently

1. Use Grep to search within the JSON for relevant entries BEFORE reading the full file
2. Only read sections you need — don't dump the entire graph into context
3. Node names and summaries are the most useful fields for understanding
4. Edges tell you how components connect — follow imports and calls for dependency chains

## Instructions

1. **Check that `.excavator/knowledge-graph.json` exists.** If not, tell the user to run `/excavator` first.

2. **Check graph freshness before using graph-derived context** — use the ONE shared, deterministic freshness helper instead of computing a separate gitCommitHash/git-diff comparison in this skill:
   - Resolve `$PROJECT_ROOT` and `$PLUGIN_ROOT`:
     ```bash
     PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)"
     SKILL_REAL=$(realpath ~/.agents/skills/excavator-onboard 2>/dev/null || readlink -f ~/.agents/skills/excavator-onboard 2>/dev/null || echo "")
     SELF_RELATIVE=$([ -n "$SKILL_REAL" ] && cd "$SKILL_REAL/../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd || echo "")
     PLUGIN_ROOT=""
     for candidate in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" "$HOME/.excavator-plugin" "$SELF_RELATIVE"; do
       if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -f "$candidate/package.json" ] && [ -f "$candidate/pnpm-workspace.yaml" ]; then
         PLUGIN_ROOT="$candidate"
         break
       fi
     done
     ```
   - Run the helper:
     ```bash
     node "$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/excavator/consumer-freshness.mjs" "$PROJECT_ROOT"
     ```
   - It prints `{ status, currentSourceRevision, manifestSourceRevision, reason }` as JSON. `status` is `fresh`, `stale`, or `missing`: it compares the CURRENT `sourceRevision` — resolved via SourceSnapshot, so a git project reads HEAD only (an uncommitted working-tree change never flips this — no working-tree leak) and a plain-directory project is guarded by a content hash over every tracked file (any content drift is caught) — against the `sourceRevision` persisted in `.excavator/source-manifest.json`.
   - `stale`: warn before generating the guide that onboarding content may omit recent changes. Suggest: Run `/excavator` to refresh the graph.
   - `missing` (no `source-manifest.json` yet): give a brief best-effort note and continue instead of blocking.
   - `fresh`: proceed with no warning.

3. **Read project metadata** — use Grep or Read with a line limit to extract the `"project"` section (name, description, languages, frameworks).

4. **Read layers** — Grep for `"layers"` to get the full layers array. These define the architecture and will structure the guide.

5. **Read file-level structural nodes only** — use Grep to find nodes with file-level types (`file`, `config`, `document`, `service`, `pipeline`, `table`, `schema`, `resource`, `endpoint`) in the knowledge graph. Skip function-level and class-level nodes to keep the guide high-level. Extract each node's `name`, `filePath`, `summary`, and `complexity`.

6. **Identify complexity hotspots** — from the file-level nodes, find those with the highest `complexity` values. These are areas new developers should approach carefully.

7. **Generate the onboarding guide** with these sections:
   - **Project Overview**: name, languages, frameworks, description (from project metadata)
   - **Architecture Layers**: each layer's name, description, and key files (from layers + file nodes)
   - **Key Concepts**: important patterns and design decisions (from node summaries and tags)
   - **File Map**: what each key file does (from file-level nodes, organized by layer)
   - **Complexity Hotspots**: areas to approach carefully (from complexity values)

8. Format as clean markdown
9. Offer to save the guide to `docs/EXCAVATOR_ONBOARDING.md` in the project
10. Suggest the user commit it to the repo for the team
